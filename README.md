# Prime Number Investigator
A prime number is an integer (that is, a whole number) that is greater than 1 and has only two factors: 1 and itself.
Here’s a list of prime numbers (note that 1 is not considered a prime number):

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281 …
